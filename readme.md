### Minesweeper Flags

#### Overview

Minesweeper flags is a variation of Minesweeper that was published by Microsoft as part of the now-deprecated MSN Messenger. This is a reworked desktop version of the game.

As opposed to conventional Minesweeper, the objective in the Flags variation is to locate the mines with the minimum number of clicks. The game ends when the player uncovers a set number of mines.
